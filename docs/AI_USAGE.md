## Summary

The main rule for AI usage is to get help on:

- What has an well defined and small scope that can be quickly reviewed and understood. _e.g.: Build parser for ISO-8601 format style, create entities._
- Things related with getting help with documentation. _e.g.: List youtube API errors._
- Project setup. _e.g.: Setup ConfigService, linter._

## Usage

- Transforming .dbml into TypeOrm entities.
- Postgres setup with TypeORM in NestJS.
- Build parser for **ISO-8601** format style and transform this into a custom ValidatorPipe.
- Setup use of ConfigService instead of getting process.env variables directly.
- Listing out Youtube API errors.
- Figure Transactions work on TypeORM.
- Setup Eslint+Prettier for the project.
- Setup the COMMIT_HISTORY_CORRECTION document base on the list of commits.
