## Summary

The main rules for AI usage in this project were to only get help with the following categories:

- Generally things with well defined and small scope that can be quickly reviewed and understood. _e.g.: Build parser for ISO-8601 format style, create entities._
- Documentation help. _e.g.: List youtube API errors._
- Project setup. _e.g.: Setup ConfigService, linter._
- Testing infrastructure and validation. _e.g.: Integration tests, unit tests, database seeding._

## Usage

- Transforming .dbml into TypeOrm entities.
- Postgres setup with TypeORM in NestJS.
- Build parser for **ISO-8601** format style and transform this into a custom ValidatorPipe.
- Setup use of ConfigService instead of getting process.env variables directly.
- Listing out Youtube API errors.
- Figure Transactions work on TypeORM.
- Setup Eslint+Prettier for the project.
- Setup the COMMIT_HISTORY_CORRECTION document base on the list of commits.
- Create unit tests for DTOs, helpers, and validators with class-validator.
- Setup integration tests for operations with Contents.
- Database seeding system for sample data with CLI scripts and automated setup.
- Enhancing README.md.
